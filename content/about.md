title = "About me"
+++

I am a Grant Research Fellow at the [University of Turku](https://utu.fi/en), hosted in the [Transients group](https://sites.utu.fi/sne/) by [Rubina Kotak](https://www.utu.fi/en/people/rubina-kotak) and [Seppo Mattila](https://www.utu.fi/en/people/seppo-mattila). I am currently funded by a [Turku University Foundation](https://www.yliopistosaatio.fi/en/home/) grant.

I completed my PhD in 2023 at the [University of Warwick](https://warwick.ac.uk) in the [Astronomy and Astrophysics](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/physics/research/astro/) group, under the supervision of [Danny Steeghs](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/physics/research/astro/people/steeghs/) and [Joseph Lyman](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/physics/research/astro/people/lyman). The core activities of my thesis were developing next-generation ML algorithms for transient discovery, classification, and characterisation, applied to the Gravitational-wave Optical Transient Observer (GOTO) datastream - it can be read [via the institutional repository](https://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/id/eprint/182423/). I remain a core team member of GOTO and survey builder.

Some key areas of scientific interest for me are:
* **ML for transient discovery:** Developing and optimizing deep learning techniques to accelerate the detection, classification, and follow-up of astronomical transients. This work aims to maximize both discovery rates and classification accuracy while minimizing response times.
* **Interacting supernovae:** what can observing the deaths of massive stars tell us about how they end their lives? 
* **Citizen science:** how can we empower and enable volunteers to make highly-impactful discoveries - and what can we learn about the "human factor" in the process?

I am always keen to start new collaborations and projects on topics of interest, particularly those with interdisciplinary elements - please do get in touch!
