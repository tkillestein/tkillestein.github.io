Moriarty is the next-generation contextual classifier powering host identification and source classifications for GOTO.

Through an ensemble of large astronomical catalogues, novel voting/combination algorithms, probabilistic host association, and decision trees, `moriarty` is able to automatically identify the likely source of astrophysical transients -- whether supernovae exploding in their host galaxy, variable stars, or truly hostless transients.

`moriarty` has provided contextual classifications to transients in the GOTO Marshall since 2023.

`moriarty` is being integrated into Kilonova Seekers to provide volunteers with more information about the objects they are discovering.
