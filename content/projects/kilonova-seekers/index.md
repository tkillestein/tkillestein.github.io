Kilonova Seekers is an innovative, real-time citizen science project that invites members of the public to find cosmic explosions in data from the [Gravitational-wave Optical Transient Observer (GOTO)](https://goto-observatory.org) survey. Volunteers are shown the science, template, and difference images that researchers inspect to identify transients, and are asked if a real transient is present.

We launched Kilonova Seekers in July 2023, and since then it has led t  81 discoveries of transients, and gained nearly 3300 registered volunteers in total - with the reach of the project likely being signfiicantly more. Many of these discoveries have been followed up and classified as supernovae by colleagues.

A landmark discovery from the project was GOTO0650, a peculiar dwarf nova which was discovered by Kilonova Seekers, and followed up with the help of volunteers using telescopes at Las Cumbres Observatory through our education program, and from an [AAVSO Alert Notice](https://apps.aavso.org/v2/campaigns/877)

Kilonova Seekers has received a number of press releases since launch - as well as being adopted by a number of university education/outreach programs in the UK and Finland.
