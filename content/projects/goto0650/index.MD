The dwarf nova GOTO065054+593624 marked the first major science result from Kilonova Seekers — discovered by volunteers
on the project, and followed up by a huge contingent of citizen scientist observers from around the world. GOTO0650 was observed by
* Nordic Optical Telescope
* Liverpool Telescope
* Las Cumbres Observatory 0.4 m network as part of Global Sky Partners
* Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory
* Einstein Probe
* AAVSO members

The paper provides an intensive study of the object, with highly complete light curves, spectroscopy, and X-ray data throughout
the 2024 superoutburst. The dataset suggests the object is a WZ Sge-like dwarf nova, a subtype that shows diverse outburst behaviour
and long recurrence timescales. GOTO0650 showed 10 "echo outburst" rebrightenings throughout the months it was active.
GOTO0650 provides another well-observed example of the class and presents further opportunities for follow-up.

The study was accepted for publication in [Astronomy and Astrophysics](https://aanda.org) in May 2025, just 7 months
after the object was first identified, with many citizen scientist co-authors.
